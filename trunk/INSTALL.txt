Dante Job Scheduler
INSTALLATION

Simply point your PHP 5.3 enabled IIS at this directory as the root of a website.
Make sure .\theme\default\tpl\ is writable.

You must have Basic authentication installed.  I have discovered that the web.config is not compatible with IIS 7.5.  So in IIS 7.5 under Authentication you must enable ASP.NET IMpersonation and Basic or Windows Authentication.

Run at your own risk :)
